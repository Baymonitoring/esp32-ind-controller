# esp32-ind-controller
I am working on a small controller based on the esp32 for industrial purposes. This is my initial version and far from what would be considered an industrial controller.
My idea is to get the first pcb up and running with the most basic components required for some type of industrial control, such as controlling relays and reading inputs.
